Great! Let’s break this down step by step to explain the **theoretical logic** behind the API endpoints and how you can **use them in a React frontend**.

---

## 🔧 THEORETICAL LOGIC OF THE ENDPOINTS

### 1. `/api/studentexam/<pk>/data/` → `StudentExamViewSet.data()`

* **Purpose**: Get all the **subject and question data** for a given student.
* **How it works**:

  * Looks up the `Student` by `student_id` (`pk` in URL).
  * Gets all `ExamGroups` the student is in.
  * Gets all `Subjects` under those `ExamGroups`.
  * Gets all `Questions` under those `Subjects`.
  * Returns all that info as a response.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "student_id": "12345",
  "subjects": [...],
  "questions": [...]
}
```

---

### 2. `/api/exam-sessions/` → `ExamSessionViewSet`

* **Purpose**: Manage the current exam session (create, fetch, update).
* **Who can use it**: Only authenticated students.
* **How it works**:

  * When a session is **created**, it automatically links to the authenticated user (student).
  * When fetching, only sessions belonging to the current student are returned.
  * The serializer changes depending on the action (`create` vs. `update`).

---

### 3. `/api/answers/` → `AnswerViewSet`

* **Purpose**: Handle saving/fetching student answers.
* **How it works**:

  * Answers are tied to a session.
  * A student can only view or submit answers to **their own sessions**.
  * When an answer is submitted, it checks that the session really belongs to the student.

## ⚛️ HOW TO USE THESE ENDPOINTS IN REACT

Let’s now see **how to use each one** from a React app. You can use `axios` or `fetch`.

---

### 1. **Fetching exam data for a student**

```js
// GET /api/studentexam/123/data/
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchExamData = async (studentId) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/studentexam/${studentId}/data/`);
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching exam data:', error);
  }
};
```

Use this to show the student their **available subjects and questions**.

---

### 2. **Creating or fetching exam session**

```js
// POST /api/exam-sessions/
const createExamSession = async (sessionData) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/api/exam-sessions/', sessionData, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` // student must be authenticated
      }
    });
    console.log('Session created:', response.data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to create session', err);
  }
};
```

```js
// GET /api/exam-sessions/
const getMySessions = async () => {
  const res = await axios.get('/api/exam-sessions/', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  return res.data;
};
```

Use this when a student **starts an exam**.

---

### 3. **Submitting answers**

```js
// POST /api/answers/
const submitAnswer = async (answerData) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/api/answers/', answerData, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    });
    console.log('Answer saved:', response.data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error saving answer:', err.response?.data);
  }
};
```

`answerData` should contain:

```json
{
  "session": 5,
  "question": 10,
  "selected_option": "b"
}
```

## ✅ IN SUMMARY

| Endpoint                      | Use in React                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/studentexam/<pk>/data/` | Load subjects + questions when exam starts       |
| `/api/exam-sessions/`         | Create/start or get exam session for the student |
| `/api/answers/`               | Submit individual answers during the exam        |

If you want, I can help you build a complete React workflow: e.g.

1. Student logs in
2. Exam session starts
3. Questions are loaded
4. Answers are submitted live
